"how to code a stocks buying function in flask python that queries a table called 'stocksinventory' in a local databse called 'stocks_application' for a stock symbol that the user can input into a form. The form will then send the order type (Buy or Sell), the order quantity (number of shares), total order amount (the amount in dollars that the shares add up to), ticker, and the date that the order was created to a table called 'orderhistory'. The total order amount will also be subtracted from the 'walletAmount' attribute in the table 'portfolio' from the local database 'stocks_application'"
